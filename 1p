suppose you have a core module called file_io that acts as a low level python service class with multiple functions related to file io operations. One such function involves intaking some data and writing that data to an xml file on disk. This particular function/xml file will always assume the exact same string tags to encapsulate the data. How would a FAANG engineer handle placing the logic to write those tags to the xml file? Would they place the logic inside the function itself? Delegate it to a utility to aovid hardcoding? There's so much they can do but only one approach is truly the best and cleanest.
